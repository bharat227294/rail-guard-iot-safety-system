# 🚦 Rail-Guard: IoT-Based Railway Safety System

**Rail-Guard** is an innovative railway safety solution designed to detect derailments and heavy obstructions on railway tracks using electromagnetic wave-based detection. The system sends real-time alerts to loco pilots to prevent collisions and improve railway safety without modifying existing infrastructure.
